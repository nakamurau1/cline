## Current Development Focus

### Active Work
1. Tool Improvements
   - read_file tool enhancement
     - ✓ **Review current implementation details**
     - Current implementation identified in `src/core/Cline.ts` and `src/integrations/misc/extract-text.ts`
     - Limitations documented: reads entire files at once, no LLM context optimization, lacks file type-based strategies
     - **Next step: Implement size-based reading strategy**
     - Changed approach: Using file size (500KB threshold) instead of line count for more efficient and clearer decision making
     - LLM context consumption optimization (addressed by size-based strategy)
     - Large file processing improvement (addressed by automatic strategy)
     - File reading strategy revision (replaced with automatic strategy)
     - ✓ **Implement size-based reading strategy**
     - ✓ **Test coverage expansion with size-based test cases**
     - Added test cases for normal-sized file reading, large file partial reading, and file info accuracy
     - Test coverage expanded:
       - Normal-sized file reading test
       - Large file partial reading test
       - File information accuracy test
     - ✓ **Error handling refinement and test case implementation**
     - ✓ **All tests passing (108 tests)**
     - ✓ **閾値を100KBに変更**: 大きなファイルの閾値を500KBから100KBに変更
     - ✓ **閾値変更後のテスト成功**: 閾値を100KBに変更後、テストを実行し成功を確認
     - Performance benchmarking with various file sizes (future consideration)

2. Documentation Updates
   - Memory bank initialization
   - System documentation
   - User guides
   - Contributing guidelines

### Completed Features
1. Tool Improvements
   - read_file tool enhancement
     - ✓ **Error handling test cases implementation**
     - ✓ **Error handling logic implementation and refinement**
     - ✓ **Full test suite passing (108 tests)**
