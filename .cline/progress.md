## Current Development Focus

### Active Work
1. Tool Improvements
   - read_file tool enhancement
     - âœ“ **Review current implementation details**
     - Current implementation identified in `src/core/Cline.ts` and `src/integrations/misc/extract-text.ts`
     - Limitations documented: reads entire files at once, no LLM context optimization, lacks file type-based strategies
     - **Next step: Implement automatic reading strategy based on file size and type**
     - LLM context consumption optimization (addressed by automatic strategy)
     - Large file processing improvement (addressed by automatic strategy)
     - File reading strategy revision (replaced with automatic strategy)
   - Implementation plan developed:
     - Line counting functionality for efficient size detection
     - File type detection enhancements
     - Strategy selection logic based on file type
     - Partial file reading capabilities
   - Test coverage expansion
   - Error handling refinement
   - Performance optimization

2. Documentation Updates
   - Memory bank initialization
   - System documentation
   - User guides
   - Contributing guidelines

### In Progress Features
1. Testing Infrastructure
   - Additional test cases
   - Test coverage improvements
   - Integration test expansion
   - Performance benchmarking

## Future Development
