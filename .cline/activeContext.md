# Active Context

## Current Work

### Tool Enhancement: read_file
1. Current Status
   - ✓ Basic implementation complete: ReadResult interface added, file size-based reading strategy implemented
   - Next step: Implement test cases

2. Implementation Progress
   - ✓ Added `ReadResult` interface (includes file size, type, path info)
   - ✓ Implemented partial reading for files over 500KB
   - ✓ Updated mentions system and read_file tool
   - ✓ All existing tests passing

3. Current Focus
   - Creating test cases in `src/integrations/misc/extract-text.test.ts`
     - Normal-sized file reading test
     - Large file partial reading test
     - File info accuracy test
     - Error handling test

## Recent Changes
- Committed implementation to feature/enhance-read-file branch
- Verified all existing tests are passing

## Next Steps
1. Create new test file
2. Implement test cases
3. Run and verify tests
4. Adjust implementation if needed

### Future Considerations
1. Performance
   - Large File Processing Optimization
     - Consideration of streaming processing
     - Dynamic processing methods based on file size
     - Implementation of partial reading
   - Context Management Improvement
     - File content summarization functionality
     - Extraction of important sections
     - Selective reading based on user purpose
   - Resource Efficiency Enhancement
     - Memory usage optimization
     - Efficient use of context window

2. User Experience
   - Review error messages
   - Consider additional feedback
   - Evaluate auto-approval settings
   - Update user documentation
