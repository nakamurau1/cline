# Active Context

## Current Work

### Tool Enhancement: read_file
1. Current Status
   - Tool is functional but has limitations with large files and lacks optimized context utilization
   - Current implementation in `src/core/Cline.ts` (tool handling) and `src/integrations/misc/extract-text.ts` (file reading)

2. Current Implementation Details
   - Supports reading text files, PDF, DOCX, and Jupyter Notebook files
   - Uses `isbinaryfile` library to detect binary files
   - Reads entire file content at once, regardless of size
   - No optimization for LLM context window consumption
   - No automatic strategy selection based on file type

3. Areas of Focus
   - Implement automatic reading strategy based on file size and type
   - Improve efficiency for large files using file size-based decision making
   - Enhance user experience by providing relevant file content quickly

4. Proposed Solution: Size-Based Reading Strategy

   - **Initial Check**: When `read_file` is called, check file size using `fs.stat()`.
   - **Size-Based Decision**:
     - If size <= 500KB: Return full file content
     - If size > 500KB: Read first 500KB and return with file info (path, type, total size)
   - **Automatic Strategy Decision**: Based on file size and type, determine reading approach:
     - Code files: `strategy="definitions"` (list code definitions)
     - Text files: `strategy="summary"` (generate summary)
     - Config files: `strategy="key"` (extract specific keys)
     - Unknown files: `strategy="full"` (read full content)
   - **Re-read with Strategy**: Cline re-executes `read_file` with determined strategy

5. Key Considerations
   - Efficient size-based file handling
   - Robust file type detection
   - Accurate strategy selection logic
   - Clear size-based thresholds and user feedback
