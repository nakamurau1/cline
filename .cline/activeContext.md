## Current Work

### Tool Enhancement: read_file
1. Current Status
   - Tool is functional but needs improvements (as previously documented)

2. Areas of Focus
   - Implement automatic reading strategy based on file size and type
   - Improve efficiency for large files
   - Enhance user experience by providing relevant file content quickly

3. Proposed Solution: Automatic Reading Strategy

   - **Initial Read**: When `read_file` is called, read the file and count lines.
   - **Line Count Check**:
     - If lines < 500: Return full file content.
     - If lines >= 500: Return first 500 lines and file info (path, type, total lines, preview content).
   - **Automatic Strategy Decision**: Cline automatically determines the best reading strategy based on file type, preview content, and task context.
     - Code files: `strategy="definitions"` (list code definitions)
     - Text files: `strategy="summary"` (generate summary)
     - Config files: `strategy="key"` (extract specific keys)
     - Unknown files: `strategy="full"` (read full content)
   - **Re-read with Strategy**: Cline re-executes `read_file` with the automatically determined strategy.

4. Key Considerations
   - Efficient line counting for large files
   - Robust file type detection
   - Accurate strategy selection logic
   - Clear communication of strategy to the user (implicit, no user choice needed)

## Recent Changes

### System Setup
1. Memory Bank Initialization
   - Created cline_docs directory
   - Initialized core documentation files:
     - productContext.md
     - systemPatterns.md
     - techContext.md
     - progress.md
     - activeContext.md (this file)

2. Documentation Structure
   - Project overview documented
   - System patterns established
   - Technical context detailed
   - Progress tracking initiated

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Tool Enhancement
