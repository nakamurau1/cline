# Active Context

## Current Work

### Tool Enhancement: read_file
1. Current Status
   - Tool is functional but needs improvements
   - Basic file reading capabilities implemented
   - Auto-approval system integration exists
   - Error handling in place

2. Areas of Focus
   - Test coverage improvement
   - Error handling enhancement
   - Performance optimization
   - Documentation updates

3. Identified Issues
   - LLM Context Consumption Problem
     - Rapid consumption of context window due to reading entire large files
     - Sending the entire file regardless of what information the user needs
     - Possibility of exhausting context with a single file read
   - Performance in large files could be improved
     - Different information needs based on file type and purpose
     - Memory usage optimization required
   - Test coverage could be expanded
   - Error messages could be more informative
   - Documentation needs updating

4. Key Considerations
   - Need for reading strategies based on file type and purpose
   - How to reflect user intent in file reading
   - Efficient use of context window

## Recent Changes

### System Setup
1. Memory Bank Initialization
   - Created cline_docs directory
   - Initialized core documentation files:
     - productContext.md
     - systemPatterns.md
     - techContext.md
     - progress.md
     - activeContext.md (this file)

2. Documentation Structure
   - Project overview documented
   - System patterns established
   - Technical context detailed
   - Progress tracking initiated

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Tool Enhancement
   - Review current read_file implementation
   - Identify test coverage gaps
   - Plan test improvements
   - Consider performance optimizations

2. Test Development
   - Create new test file for read_file
   - Implement test cases for:
     - Normal operation
     - Error conditions
     - Edge cases
     - Performance scenarios

3. Documentation
   - Update tool documentation
   - Add test documentation
   - Improve error message documentation
   - Document performance considerations

### Future Considerations
1. Performance
   - Large File Processing Optimization
     - Consideration of streaming processing
     - Dynamic processing methods based on file size
     - Implementation of partial reading
   - Context Management Improvement
     - File content summarization functionality
     - Extraction of important sections
     - Selective reading based on user purpose
   - Resource Efficiency Enhancement
     - Memory usage optimization
     - Efficient use of context window

2. User Experience
   - Review error messages
   - Consider additional feedback
   - Evaluate auto-approval settings
   - Update user documentation
