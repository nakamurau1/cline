# Active Context

## Current Work

### Tool Enhancement: read_file
1. Current Status
   - Tool is functional but has limitations with large files and lacks optimized context utilization
   - Current implementation is in `src/core/Cline.ts` (tool handling) and `src/integrations/misc/extract-text.ts` (file reading)

2. Current Implementation Details
   - Supports reading text files, PDF, DOCX, and Jupyter Notebook files
   - Uses `isbinaryfile` library to detect binary files
   - Reads entire file content at once, regardless of size
   - No optimization for LLM context window consumption
   - No automatic strategy selection based on file type

3. Areas of Focus
   - Implement automatic reading strategy based on file size and type
   - Improve efficiency for large files
   - Enhance user experience by providing relevant file content quickly

4. Proposed Solution: Automatic Reading Strategy

   - **Initial Read**: When `read_file` is called, read the file and count lines.
   - **Line Count Check**:
     - If lines < 500: Return full file content.
     - If lines >= 500: Return first 500 lines and file info (path, type, total lines, preview content).
   - **Automatic Strategy Decision**: Cline automatically determines the best reading strategy based on file type, preview content, and task context.
     - Code files: `strategy="definitions"` (list code definitions)
     - Text files: `strategy="summary"` (generate summary)
     - Config files: `strategy="key"` (extract specific keys)
     - Unknown files: `strategy="full"` (read full content)
   - **Re-read with Strategy**: Cline re-executes `read_file` with the automatically determined strategy.

5. Key Considerations
   - Efficient line counting for large files
   - Robust file type detection
   - Accurate strategy selection logic
   - Clear communication of strategy to the user (implicit, no user choice needed)
