# System Patterns

## Architecture Patterns

### VS Code Extension Architecture
1. Core Components
   - Main Extension (`src/extension.ts`)
   - Core Cline Class (`src/core/Cline.ts`)
   - API Providers (`src/api/providers/`)
   - Integrations (`src/integrations/`)
   - Services (`src/services/`)

2. Tool Implementation Pattern
   - Tools are implemented as case statements in Cline class
   - Each tool has validation, execution, and error handling
   - Tools support auto-approval configuration
   - Tools emit events for UI updates

3. Message Flow
   - User messages → API requests
   - API responses → Tool executions
   - Tool results → User feedback
   - Checkpoints at key stages

### Extension Features

1. Internationalization (i18n)
   - Supports multiple languages
   - Localized documentation
   - Language-specific interfaces

2. Security Model
   - Human-in-the-loop approval system
   - File access control through .clineignore
   - Safe terminal command execution
   - Workspace state checkpointing

3. UI Components
   - Webview-based chat interface
   - Diff view for file changes
   - Terminal integration
   - Browser control panel

### Key Technical Decisions

1. API Integration
   - Support for multiple AI providers
   - Unified interface through provider abstraction
   - Token and cost tracking
   - Automatic retry and error handling

2. File System Handling
   - Safe file operations
   - Diff view for changes
   - Directory traversal controls
   - File content caching

3. Model Context Protocol (MCP)
   - Custom tool creation
   - Server management
   - Dynamic capability extension
   - Resource access control

4. Browser Integration
   - Headless browser control
   - Screenshot capture
   - Console log monitoring
   - Interactive page manipulation

## Development Patterns

1. Code Organization
   - Modular architecture
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Type-safe implementations
   - Extensive test coverage

2. Error Handling
   - Graceful degradation
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Automatic retry mechanisms
   - State recovery options

3. Performance Considerations
   - Context window management
   - File system operation optimization
   - Efficient API usage
   - Resource cleanup

4. Testing Strategy
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests for tools
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performance benchmarking
