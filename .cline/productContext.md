# Product Context

## Purpose
Cline is an AI assistant for VS Code that can use both the Command Line Interface (CLI) and Editor, making it a powerful tool for software development tasks. Unlike traditional AI assistants, Cline has direct access to development tools and can interact with them in a controlled, safe manner.

## Problems Solved
1. Complex Development Tasks Automation
   - File creation and editing with diff view support
   - Terminal command execution with output monitoring
   - Browser interaction for testing and debugging
   - Safe, human-in-the-loop operation for all actions

2. Development Context Management
   - Analyzes file structures and source code ASTs
   - Performs regex searches across codebases
   - Manages information flow to prevent context window overflow
   - Monitors linter/compiler errors proactively

3. Extensibility Challenges
   - Implements Model Context Protocol (MCP) for custom tool creation
   - Supports multiple AI providers (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
   - Allows local model usage through LM Studio/Ollama

## How It Works
1. Task Input
   - Users can provide text descriptions of tasks
   - Supports image input for visual task understanding
   - Context can be added via @url, @problems, @file, and @folder mentions

2. Analysis Phase
   - Examines project structure and relevant files
   - Uses AST parsing for code understanding
   - Performs targeted searches as needed

3. Execution Phase
   - Creates/edits files with diff view for approval
   - Executes terminal commands with output monitoring
   - Uses browser for testing and debugging when needed
   - Takes checkpoints for safe state management

4. Feedback Loop
   - Monitors for errors and issues
   - Provides progress updates
   - Allows user intervention and guidance
   - Supports task checkpointing and restoration
